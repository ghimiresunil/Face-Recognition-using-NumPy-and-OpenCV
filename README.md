# Face recognition python

## Introduction:

Today, we have come up with a new python tutorial to build a face recognition program based on Python and OpenCV. As asked by some of the followers on Instagram [@_tech_tutor](https://www.instagram.com/_tech_tutor/). Today in this tutorial we are going to show something real beautiful program. Here, we are using Python 3.7.3, OpenCV, and some other Python libraries (NumPy, Dlib, CMake, and face_recognition) to build a face recognition program. But, the interesting point is that you can use any version of Python and OpenCV to run this script. We are going to develop a Python script that can detect whatever faces you like, it may be faces of your friends, faces of your relatives, faces of your best celebrities, faces of your idol. So, after developing a Python script you will be able to detect and recognize any faces you like and as many as you like. So what it does in this Python Script is actually drawing rectangular boxes around the faces and attempting to classify which ones they are based on a list of the provided faces. Otherwise, it will just show unknown but it still draws a rectangular box around the face. 

<b><i> Note: You just need to install a C++ compiler on your computer. You can download the C++  compiler while installing the Visual Studio Community version. </i></b>

## Steps involved to run project: 

* Install the Python modules which are specified in <code> requirements.txt</code>
* Within the root directory, there is the folder named <code> faces </code> which includes all the known faces, and that will be how faces of people are recognized and detected by the system.
* Within the root directory, there is the folder named <code> test </code> where you can place your own images in which faces are recognized and detected.
* The final step is to run the python script named <code>face_rec.py</code>.
* At last, Press </code>'q’</code> to exit the program
